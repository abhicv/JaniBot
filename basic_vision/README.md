## INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING WITH THE CONTROLLER 

#### The controller named my_controller in the file my_controller uses OpenCV, to filter the image , run it with webots 
#### In the .wbt file , you need a camera named "camera" and a display named "display"
#### If on windows , set OpenCV_DIR to wherever opencv is installed  (eg for me it is E:\vision\opencv3xx\opencv)
#### Visual studio ain't a linux thing , but if needed just apt install and link using gcc (lots of tutorials out there )
#### You might also need to add $(OpenCV_DIR)/x64/lib to path

- I have used opencv 3.4.6 here , which is what  is was installed   during the ROS2 setup
