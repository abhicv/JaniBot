Janitorial Robot development repository for ArtPark Robotics Challenge


#### Instructions to use the realsense plugin 
Clone this repository https://github.com/pal-robotics/realsense_gazebo_plugin into `{catkin workspace}/src`

run `source devel/setup.bash` 

run `catkin_make` , this sets up the `librealsense_gazebo_plugin.so` used in the controller

and as always , run `source devel/setup.bash` for everything to be visible 

after this , just run the thing , it'll work (Hopefully)!
